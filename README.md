simulated banking app targeted towards children to teach financial responsibility

Goal: present a simulated responsibility system for children to use with/without their parents
No real money is involved, operates on a points scale that can be customized as needed, points traded in for rewards also determined by the parent/guardian

Can be used in other ways, this is just the original premise of the app
